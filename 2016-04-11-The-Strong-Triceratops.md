Introduction

     The baby triceratop yelled "STOP!!!  You can't just talk about my parents.  You need to look forward into the future."  The other Triceratops started to listen.  “But… You need to listen to me!!!” The baby triceratop said.  If you want to read more, then read this book!!!

Chapter 1 

The Nice Dinosaur

      Once upon a time, there was a Triceratops family in a good place in the forest.  There were no animals or other dino's attacking them.  It was until one day a baby triceratops was born.  He was a newborn and he got more of the attention.  But a tyrannosaurus rex heard about the Baby Triceratops.  The T. Rex told all of the other ones and they went in attack.  Unfortunately the baby ran away from it’s parents and his parents died.  The baby wondered around until he found an undiscovered cave. There the baby laid hungry, thirsty, unhealthy.  Then the baby fell to sleep.  When the baby woke up he searched for something to eat.  The baby found some **fern**.  He tried the fern.  He thought it was delicious.  He ate all of it.  HE felt like his hunger bar was full, and he went away.  His thirst bar was all full.  His energy bar was at 100%.  He went for but he was still thirsty.  He wondered around and found a lake.  He drank out of the lake a long walk to find some more dino’s to be friends.

Chapter 2

The Other Adorable Abandoned Triceratops

      After he walked for a long time, he had found some more triceratops.  He went to the other abandoned triceratops.  They all gasped when they saw him.  "It's the triceratops that ran away from home and the Tyrannosaurus Rex killed his momma and papa."  One of the triceratops said.  They all started talking at once.  The baby triceratop yelled” STOP!!!  you can’t just talk about my parents.  You need to look forward into the future.”  The triceratops started to listen.  ¨But…  ¨You need to listen to me!!!¨  The baby triceratop said.  ¨Have you ever got to see your parents in a long time.¨  The baby triceratop said in a strict voice.  ¨Who wants to find their parents.¨  ¨We do!!!¨  Said all of the triceratops.  ¨Then let's go!¨  Said The Strong one.  

Chapter 3

The Triceratops Unite

     The baby triceratop lead the others to the Tyrannosaurus Rex cave.  They snuck in the back door.  The triceratops started running and got trapped.  ¨We were expecting you.¨  Said one of the T. Rex.  ¨You were???¨  Said the Baby triceratop who had not moved at all and did not get trapped.   Evan though the fight didn't begin the baby triceratop had a talking fight.  But before I can tell you that story I have to tell you this story.

Chapter 4

The T. Rex Plans

     Now you may be asking yourself ¨How did the T. Rex know that they were coming?¨  The T. Rex had a plan.  Now let's go back to the 1 minute speech that was told by the Baby triceratop.  Why he was telling everyone the speech, someone was listening.  Someone big and humongous.  Someone… "Hey!"  Shouted the baby triceratop who was interrupting the narrator.  “You are messing up my speech.”  Well you need to shut your piehole.  I'm the narrator.  I am telling this story, so i can interrupt at any time today.  “Ok.”  The baby said.  Now where was I.  Ok now a mig T. Rex was snooping around and listening to the triceratop speech.  The mighty T. Rex told his boss and he was frustrated.  “We need to make a plan.”  Said the mighty king.  Then they made a plan.  “Maybe we can make a trap and then they will fall into it.”  Said one of the T. Rex.  “I like that idea.”  Said the king.

Chapter 5

The Talking Fight

     The baby triceratops said some words he did not even know that it was trash talking.  The king was pleased that a baby would say that stuff.  "You are very special."  Said the king.  “Maybe you can join our T. Rex team and conquer the universe.”  “Never!”  Said the baby looking really mad.  He said a few more naughty words.  The king said “That's enough talking for now.”  “Now do you accept or decline.”  It will take the triceratop to think about this so sit back and wait for a little bit.  Besides, you need to take a break anyways, now go and read a different book for about 2 hours and he will be ready.  

 After the 2 Hour reading time... 

Your back.  You needed to be or else you would miss the other part of Chapter 5 so read in your head.  you don't want to get in trouble with your parents/teacher, so no more talking.  Just reading in the noggin.  "I am sorry but I just want to get the others to their parents."  The baby said in a stiff voice.  “Then it is final.”  Said the mighty king.  “You will be executed with the other triceratops.”  Just a the T. Rex was about to attack, the baby triceratops stabbed the king and tackled him.  “Oww.”  Said the T. Rex king.  “No one messes with the Strong Triceratops.”  The baby said in the most strict voice you would ever hear.

Chapter 6

The Baby Triceratops Finds His Meaning in Life

           The baby triceratop would soon figure out that his meaning in life which is to help all triceratops who are trying to find the most special place, home.  The baby freed his friends and walked up to the T. Rexes. They got scared and ran away but it was too late.  Just then all of the triceratops tackled and stabbed the T. Rexes and they died.  "Now let's go find your parents herd."  Said the baby in a small voice.  Now he had found his meaning in life and would always remember it.  He went on other adventures but this story is not is not over.  There is more to the story than you think.  The baby still had to go on an adventure to find the parents to the triceratops.

Chapter 7

The Tall Mountains

     The baby had no clue what he was about to go through.  He didn't know that there was about 20 mountains near him that he would have to climb to get to the other side.  "I think a see a steep hill."  Said one of the triceratops.  “Me too.”  Said the other.  “I don’t see anything.”  Said the baby.  Then he spotted the mountain and he gasped.  “We have to walk up a STEEP HILL!!!”  Said the baby in the loudest voice he could have.  Just then a new type of dino they had not seen before.  “I am a apatosaurus.”  Said the dino.  “Need a lift?”  “Yeah.  We need a lift.”  The baby said.  “I will go get some of my friends.  They will help get the others.”  Said the apatosaurus in a stiff voice.  He went away and came back an hour later and helped the others op about 19 mountains.  “We are exhausted.”  Said one of the apatosaurus.  “We will start here and you will go up the last mountain”  “I THOUGHT IT WAS A STEEP HILL!!!!!”  The baby yelled.  They finally stopped talking and went up the hill.  It took 2 days to get up the hill and down.

Chapter 8

The Triceratop Stomp

          The baby had been walking day and night.  Others would call it the long walk, but I like to call it the triceratop stomp.  After the triceratop stomp was over they went to rest at the same place the baby had laid a couple of days ago.  He was now at the place close to where his parents died, but he was not worried.  When he had left the spot and kept walking, the triceratops stomp would go on until the end of the dinosaurs.  That is not really necessary right now but now we can progress to Chapter 9 but before chapter 9, you will need to get a drink.

Chapter 9

The Dinosaur Ages  

                   Everyone knows about the dinosaur ages.  We are going to take a break and talk about the dinosaur ages.  Now everyone knows about a T. Rex.  If you don't know what a T. Rex is, it is the king of the jungle.  I chose the king T. Rex from the phrase from a T. Rex book "King Of The Jungle".  I chose a baby triceratop because they are precious little babies.  These are a few questions but now let's finish this story on chapter 10.

Chapter 10

The Parents Are Found

     The baby had crossed mountains and done a few amazing things.  Now since this is the final chapter I wanted to get done with it.  let's go!  "Ok guys."  Said the baby triceratop.  “We need to get to the fields.  That is the place that the parents are.”  “Yay for you whatever your name is.”  Said the others.  “Let's run to get to the fields quickly.”  He said in a quiet voice.  They all started running and then they had got to the fields.  All of the parents saw them and realised they were one of their sons or daughters.  The parents started running for their children.  “We have missed you kids.”  Said the parents why they sobbed quietly.  Once the babies pointed to the one that had saved them and taken  them to their parents he was gone.  He had gone on a different adventure but that is another book…     Which is the next book!     Will he save Gracie the cat from Face Rig.  Find out in…
